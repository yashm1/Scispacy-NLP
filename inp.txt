In PES treatment, the high temperature of treatment aects the surface hardening procedure [3,4],
thus, this technique was termed \heating in electrolytic
plasma". Furthermore, the phenomenon of electrolyte
components diusion into the surface of the electrode
was also noticed. During previous studies, these eects
were used to develop a set of processes directed to
the surface saturation of bulk materials with various
alloying elements [5,6], thus new innovations for the
industrial application of the technique, termed Plasma
Electrolytic Saturation (PES), developed. However,
further investigation of the plasma electrolytic processes requires an understanding of the physical and
chemical background of the plasma phenomena and
nitrocarburized layer formation. In order to nd out
the principles of the plasma electrolytic processes,
reviewing and nding a phenomenological model in
the generic term of Plasma Electrolytic Saturation
(PES) is required. Therefore, the purpose of this
work is to clarify the Plasma Electrolytic Nitrocarburizing (PEN/C) procedures as a kind of PES technique. These procedures chie
y consist of electrolyte
decomposition, dielectric discharge phenomenon, heat
transfer from the plasma environment to the carbon
and nitrogen particles and, nally, diusion route,
respectively. These concepts, as a model of the Plasma
Electrolytic Saturation (PES) technique, can provide
asset information for the researchers to take control
over the treatment.
